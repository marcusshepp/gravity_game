This game was made by Jeremy Gagnier in 2010.

I am making an Artificial Neural Network for the game.

The Network has the capability to serialize it's `best guess`.
Biologoical Model ie. the logic for a Genetic Algorthim,
is used for finding the corrent Weights and Thesholds to the 
Artificial Neural Network illustrated below. 


TODO:
 - Pick up where we left off

To Run:

`pip3 install pygame`
`python3 gravity_game.py`
