I am making an Artificial Neural Network for the game.

The Network has the capability to serialize it's `best guess`.
Biologoical Model ie. the logic for a Genetic Algorthim,
is used for finding the correct Weights and Thesholds to the 
ann illustrated below. 



TODO:
 - Pick up where we left off



Set up:

- python3 required
